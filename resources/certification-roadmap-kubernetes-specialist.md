## Exam Preparation

### CKA/CKAD/CKS Exam Tips

| Practice in terminal | Exams are hands-on - no multiple choice |
| Know kubectl shortcuts | `kubectl run`, `kubectl create`, `--dry-run=client -o yaml` |
| Bookmark docs | kubernetes.io/docs is allowed during exam |
| Time management | 15-20 tasks in 2 hours - budget 6-7 minutes per task |
| Use aliases | `alias k=kubectl`, `export do="--dry-run=client -o yaml"` |
| Practice under pressure | Use simulators (killer.sh - included with exam registration) |
| YAML generation | Use `kubectl create` and `kubectl run` to generate YAML templates |
| Context switching | Always check and switch kubectl context per question |

### Essential kubectl Commands

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Create deployment | `kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --replicas=3` |
| Expose service | `kubectl expose deployment nginx --port=80 --type=ClusterIP` |
| Generate YAML | `kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml` |
| Debug pod | `kubectl logs pod-name`, `kubectl describe pod pod-name` |
| Execute in pod | `kubectl exec -it pod-name -- /bin/sh` |
| Scale | `kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=5` |
| Rollback | `kubectl rollout undo deployment nginx` |
| Get all resources | `kubectl get all -n namespace` |
| Apply manifest | `kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml` |

## Key Exam Tips

1. **CKA/CKAD/CKS are hands-on** - you must be fast and accurate with kubectl and YAML
2. Master imperative commands (`kubectl create`, `kubectl run`) for speed - generate YAML rather than writing from scratch
3. Practice with killer.sh (2 free sessions included with exam registration)
4. Know the Kubernetes docs site structure - you can use it during the exam
5. For CKS, understand the full supply chain from image build to runtime
6. Cloud-specific exams focus on managed service integration rather than raw Kubernetes
7. Set up aliases and environment variables at the start of each exam session
8. Always verify your work after each task before moving on
