# IaC Concepts and Terraform Overview

## Overview

This document covers Infrastructure as Code (IaC) fundamentals and Terraform's purpose, architecture, and advantages. These topics account for 30% of the exam (Domains 1 and 2 combined), making them critical for certification success.

**[📖 Introduction to Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro)** - Official introduction to Terraform and IaC concepts

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Concepts

### What is Infrastructure as Code?
- Managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files
- Replaces manual processes with automated, repeatable deployments
- Infrastructure is versioned, shared, and reused like application code
- Enables consistent environments across development, staging, and production

### Key IaC Principles
- **Declarative:** Describe the desired end state, not the steps to get there
- **Idempotent:** Running the same configuration multiple times produces the same result
- **Version Controlled:** Track changes to infrastructure in source control
- **Self-Documenting:** Configuration files serve as documentation of the infrastructure
- **Reproducible:** Same configuration produces identical environments every time

### Declarative vs Imperative

| Aspect | Declarative (Terraform) | Imperative (Scripts/Ansible) |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Approach | Define desired state | Define step-by-step actions |
| Idempotency | Built-in | Must be implemented manually |
| State | Tracked automatically | Not tracked inherently |
| Readability | High - shows end state | Varies - shows process |
| Example | "There should be 3 servers" | "Create a server, then another, then another" |

### Benefits of IaC
- **Consistency:** Eliminate configuration drift and manual errors
- **Speed:** Deploy infrastructure in minutes instead of days
- **Collaboration:** Teams can review and approve infrastructure changes
- **Auditability:** Full history of who changed what and when
- **Reusability:** Modules and templates reduce duplication
- **Cost Reduction:** Automate teardown of unused resources
- **Disaster Recovery:** Quickly rebuild infrastructure from code

## Terraform Purpose and Architecture

### Why Terraform?
- **Provider agnostic:** Works with AWS, Azure, GCP, and 3000+ providers
- **State management:** Tracks real-world infrastructure state
- **Execution plans:** Preview changes before applying them
- **Resource graph:** Automatic dependency resolution and parallel execution
- **Modularity:** Reusable modules for common infrastructure patterns
- **Community:** Large ecosystem of providers and modules in the registry

**[📖 Terraform Use Cases](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro/use-cases)** - Common Terraform scenarios

### Terraform Architecture
```
                    Terraform CLI
                         |
                  Terraform Core
                    /    |    \
              Provider  Provider  Provider
               (AWS)   (Azure)    (GCP)
                |        |         |
              AWS API  Azure API  GCP API
```

- **Terraform Core:** Reads configuration, manages state, builds resource graph
- **Providers:** Plugins that translate Terraform calls to API calls
- **State:** JSON file tracking managed infrastructure
- **Registry:** Repository of providers and modules

**[📖 Terraform Architecture](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin)** - Plugin-based architecture details

### Provider Plugin System
- Providers are distributed separately from Terraform core
- Downloaded during `terraform init`
- Each provider manages a specific set of resources and data sources
- Versioned independently from Terraform
- Can be sourced from HashiCorp, verified partners, or community

**[📖 Provider Documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/providers)** - Provider configuration and management

### Terraform Workflow
1. **Write:** Define infrastructure in HCL configuration files
2. **Plan:** Preview what Terraform will change (`terraform plan`)
3. **Apply:** Execute the changes to create/modify infrastructure (`terraform apply`)

This three-step workflow is the foundation of all Terraform operations.
