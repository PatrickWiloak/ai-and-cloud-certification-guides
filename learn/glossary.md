## Cloud Fundamentals

<a id="term-availability-zone-az"></a>**Availability Zone (AZ)** - A physically separate datacenter (or cluster) inside a cloud region. AZs in the same region are connected by low-latency links. You spread workloads across AZs to survive a single datacenter failure.

<a id="term-bare-metal"></a>**Bare metal** - A physical server you rent, no hypervisor, no virtualization layer. Used when you need maximum performance or specific hardware.

<a id="term-cloud-computing"></a>**Cloud computing** - On-demand delivery of compute, storage, networking, and software over the internet, billed by usage instead of owned outright.

<a id="term-cold-storage"></a>**Cold storage** - Cheap, slow storage for data you rarely access (archives, backups, compliance retention). Examples: S3 Glacier, Azure Archive Blob, GCS Coldline.

<a id="term-compute"></a>**Compute** - Anything that runs code: VMs, containers, serverless functions, batch jobs.

<a id="term-edge-edge-computing"></a>**Edge / Edge computing** - Compute that runs close to the user (CDN points of presence, local devices) instead of in a central region. Lower latency for end users.

<a id="term-elasticity"></a>**Elasticity** - The ability to automatically scale resources up and down based on demand. Distinguished from "scalability" (which just means "can grow").

<a id="term-hybrid-cloud"></a>**Hybrid cloud** - Mixing on-premises infrastructure with public cloud, with networking and identity that span both.

<a id="term-hypervisor"></a>**Hypervisor** - The software layer that runs VMs on physical hardware. Examples: KVM, Xen, Hyper-V, VMware ESXi.

<a id="term-iaas-infrastructure-as-a-service"></a>**IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** - You rent raw VMs, networks, and storage. You manage the OS and everything above it. Examples: EC2, Azure VMs, GCE.

<a id="term-multi-cloud"></a>**Multi-cloud** - Using two or more public clouds (AWS + GCP, Azure + AWS, etc.) for workloads. Different from hybrid (which mixes on-prem and cloud).

<a id="term-multi-tenant"></a>**Multi-tenant** - A single instance of software/infrastructure serves many customers, with isolation between them. Most SaaS is multi-tenant.

<a id="term-on-premises-on-prem"></a>**On-premises (on-prem)** - Infrastructure you own and run in your own datacenter (or office closet).

<a id="term-paas-platform-as-a-service"></a>**PaaS (Platform as a Service)** - Provider manages OS, runtime, scaling. You deploy code. Examples: Heroku, Elastic Beanstalk, App Engine, Render.

<a id="term-region"></a>**Region** - A geographic area (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-2) containing multiple AZs. Latency between regions is high; you typically deploy per region.

<a id="term-reserved-instance-reservation-committed-use-discount"></a>**Reserved Instance / Reservation / Committed Use Discount** - Pre-pay or commit to using a resource for 1-3 years in exchange for a big discount.

<a id="term-saas-software-as-a-service"></a>**SaaS (Software as a Service)** - You use software over the internet; provider runs everything. Examples: Gmail, Salesforce, Slack, Notion.

<a id="term-serverless"></a>**Serverless** - You write code; the platform runs it on demand and bills per execution. No servers for you to manage. Examples: Lambda, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, Azure Functions.

<a id="term-shared-responsibility-model"></a>**Shared responsibility model** - The cloud provider secures the cloud; you secure what you put **in** the cloud. Where the line is depends on the service (more services managed = less for you).

<a id="term-spot-preemptible-instance"></a>**Spot / Preemptible Instance** - A cheap VM the provider can reclaim with little notice. Good for fault-tolerant batch work, bad for stateful production.

<a id="term-tenancy"></a>**Tenancy** - Whether your resources share hardware with others (shared tenancy) or run on dedicated hardware (dedicated tenancy).

<a id="term-virtual-machine-vm"></a>**Virtual machine (VM)** - A simulated computer running on shared physical hardware via a hypervisor.
